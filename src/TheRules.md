This game doesn't have a name yet but it is based on [Monster of the Week by Ryan Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_of_the_Week), [Absurdia by Quinn Majeski](https://quinnm.itch.io/absurdia) , and [Fate Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/basics), three absolutely amazing role-playing games that everyone should enjoy.

## Core Concepts

Every game session is called an **Episode**.

Episodes contain several **scenes**.

The game is run by a **Steward** and contains a handful of **Protagonists**.

This is a [PbtA] game and is thus based on a 2d6 dice roll system for rolls.

## Stats

There are four stats:
- Acuity - Used to find clues, improvise, hide and evade, 
- Audacity - Used to act under pressure, engage the enemy, be brave
- Empathy - Used to say the right thing in the moment, sway others, convince people
- Oddity - Used to engage with the weird, mysterious, arcane

Every player starts with a -1, 0, +1, and +2 placed in each stat.

## Portfolios

There are five **Portfolios** players can choose from.
- The **Unnatural**
- The **Magical**
- The **Regular**
- The **Outsider**
- The **Hunter**

Each Player starts with 1 Karma and can get a total of 3.

- On a failed roll, (6 or less), something very bad happens.
- On a 7 - 9, a protagonist must make a choice.
- On a 10 - 12, the rotagonist is successful in their action
- On a 13+, the player gets a stupendous success 

Rolls can be **Boosted** or **Nerfed** giving +1 or -1 based on certain circumstances.
